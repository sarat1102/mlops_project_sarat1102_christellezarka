Project Description
This project offers a comprehensive framework for building and deploying an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) pipeline that follows industry-standard MLOps best practices.
It is designed for students and professionals who aim to gain hands-on experience
in integrating machine learning workflows with modern software engineering and operationalization principles.

Key Highlights
•	Flexible Dataset and Problem: Choose any open-source dataset and define the ML problem, offering customization for your interests.
•	Modern Python Project Structure: The project uses a src layout for modular and scalable code organization.
•	MLOps Integration: Implements a robust machine learning workflow that covers model training, evaluation, and deployment.
•	Comprehensive Tooling: Utilizes tools and libraries for configuration, testing, logging, automation, containerization, and CI/CD.

Project Goals
1.	Build a Modular Python Package: Create reusable, modular, and extensible components for the ML pipeline.
2.	Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Use OOP principles and design patterns like Factory, Strategy, and Adapter to maintain efficient and readable code.
3.	Adopt Best Practices: Follow Python development best practices, including typing, linting, formatting, and testing.
4.	Leverage MLOps Tools: Implement MLOps tools to facilitate smooth integration, deployment, and monitoring of ML models.
5.	Demonstrate Complete ML Lifecycle: Cover the entire ML pipeline, from data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training, to deployment, monitoring, and alerting.

CLI Usage Example
1.	Training the Model:
        poetry run train
This will initiate the model training process using the selected dataset and configurations.
2.	Inference:
        poetry run inference --input <data_file_path>
This will generate predictions using the trained model on new input data.
